> A CLI template project built with TypeScript and modern tooling.

## ✨ Features

* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Likely offers a CLI tool, given the presence of `bin` in `package.json` and libraries like `consola` for logging.
* **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Utilizes Axios for handling API requests, indicating support for asynchronous data operations.
* **Type Safety:** Leverages TypeScript to improve code quality and reduce runtime errors.
* **Fast Development Workflow:** Uses `tsup` as a build tool, enabling quick and optimized builds for TypeScript projects.
* **Utility-Driven Design:** Employs libraries like `ufo` and `picocolors` for URL manipulation and terminal styling, respectively, enhancing developer experience.
* **Configurable Settings:** Integrates `rc9` for configuration file handling, suggesting flexibility in user-defined settings.
* **Focus on Code Quality:** Includes ESLint with Antfu's configuration, indicating attention to clean and maintainable code.

## 🚀 Getting Started
